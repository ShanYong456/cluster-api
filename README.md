# Cluster API Project

This project implements an API for clustering location data using the **DBSCAN** algorithm, built with **Flask** for easy deployment. The API processes location data, performs clustering, and provides two possible solutions for grouping locations based on priorities and time constraints. The results are visualized on interactive maps generated using **Folium**.

## Features

* **Location Clustering**: Using DBSCAN, this API clusters a list of location data based on geographical coordinates.
* **Clustering Solutions**:

  1. **Solution 1**: Assign Locations to a User-Defined Number of Days
  2. **Solution 2**: Distribute Locations Across the Optimal Minimum Number of Days
* **Map Visualizations**: Generates HTML files with visual maps for each day, showing the clustered locations.
* **Dynamic API Response**: Returns clustering results in a JSON format that includes location details (latitude, longitude, priority, etc.).

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Flask
* Scikit-learn
* Folium
* Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask scikit-learn folium numpy
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed and use the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the API**:
   To start the Flask API, simply run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Usage

### Endpoint: `/get_clusters`

**Method**: `POST`

**Request Body** (JSON):

```json
{
  "locations_sorted": [
    ["start_lat", "start_lon", 1, 2],  // Example of location data: [latitude, longitude, priority, stay_hours]
    ["lat1", "lon1", 2, 3],
    ["lat2", "lon2", 1, 1]
  ],
  "requested_days": 2,
  "max_hours_per_day": 10
}
```

* `locations_sorted`: A sorted list of locations with attributes: latitude, longitude, priority, and stay hours.
* `requested_days`: The number of days the locations should be spread across.
* `max_hours_per_day`: The maximum number of hours that can be allocated for visits each day.

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "solution1": {
    "day1": [
      {
        "latitude": "lat1",
        "longitude": "lon1",
        "priority": 1,
        "stay_hours": 3,
        "cluster_id": 1
      },
      {

        "longitude": "lon2",
        "priority": 2,
        "stay_hours": 4,

      "locations": [
        {
          "latitude": "lat1",
          "longitude": "lon1",
          "priority": 2,
          "stay_hours": 4,
          "cluster_id": 1
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "day": 2,
      "locations": [
        {
          "latitude": "lat2",
          "longitude": "lon2",
          "priority": 1,
          "stay_hours": 3,
          "cluster_id": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


## Usage

### Solution 1: Assign Locations to a User-Defined Number of Days

In this solution, the user specifies the **number of days** they want to allocate for the trip. The algorithm then attempts to assign locations to these days such that no dayâ€™s total time exceeds the **maximum hours per day**.

#### Steps:

1. **Input Data**: Provide your dataset with location information, including the time required for each location.

2. **Run the Function**:

   You can execute the function for this solution by running the following code:

   ```python
   from scheduling import assign_to_fixed_days  # Ensure this is the correct path to your function

   locations = [
       {"location": "Marina Bay Sands", "hours": 4},
       {"location": "Gardens by the Bay", "hours": 2},
       {"location": "Sentosa", "hours": 5},
       {"location": "Chinatown", "hours": 3}
   ]

   max_hours_per_day = 8
   days_requested = 2  # User defines how many days they want to allocate
   assignments = assign_to_fixed_days(locations, max_hours_per_day, days_requested)
   print(assignments)
   ```

3. **Output**: The result will show the locations assigned to each day, ensuring the total time per day does not exceed the specified **maximum hours per day**.

### Solution 2: Distribute Locations Across the Optimal Minimum Number of Days

In this solution, the algorithm calculates the **minimum number of days** required to visit all locations. The total time for each day will not exceed the **maximum hours per day** limit, and locations are distributed across the fewest days possible.

#### Steps:

1. **Input Data**: Provide your dataset with location information, including the time required for each location.

2. **Run the Function**:

   You can execute the function for this solution by running:

   ```python
   from scheduling import distribute_to_optimal_days  # Ensure this is the correct path to your function

   locations = [
       {"location": "Marina Bay Sands", "hours": 4},
       {"location": "Gardens by the Bay", "hours": 2},
       {"location": "Sentosa", "hours": 5},
       {"location": "Chinatown", "hours": 3}
   ]

   max_hours_per_day = 8
   optimal_day_assignments = distribute_to_optimal_days(locations, max_hours_per_day)
   print(optimal_day_assignments)
   ```

3. **Output**: The result will show how the locations are distributed across the **minimum number of days** required, with no day exceeding the specified **maximum hours per day**.

### Visualization

The API generates visual maps for each day, where the clusters are plotted with markers indicating their geographic locations.

### Example Output Map:

Each day in the solution results in an HTML map file (e.g., `day_1.html`), which opens automatically in your browser.
